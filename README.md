## 🛠️ Local Development

Built with [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) and the [**Starlight**](https://starlight.astro.build/) framework. This project uses [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/) as the primary runtime and package manager.

### Installation
```bash
bun install
```

### Development Server
Start the development server with hot-module replacement:
```bash
bun run dev
```

### Build & Validate
Prepare the project for production and check for potential issues:
```bash
bun run build    # Build static site
bun run check    # Run Astro sync and TypeScript checks
```

## AI & MCP Integration

This documentation is designed to be highly accessible to AI agents and developers.

### LLMS Discovery
The site automatically generates AI-friendly summaries at the root:
- `/llms.txt`: High-level summary of the documentation structure.
- `/llms-full.txt`: Full concatenated text content for RAG and context window loading.

### MCP Server
The repository includes a read-only MCP server that allows AI clients to browse and search the documentation structure programmatically.

```bash
# Run via stdio (for local AI clients)
bun run mcp

# Run via HTTP (JSON-RPC endpoint)
bun run mcp:http
```
*Note: The HTTP endpoint defaults to `http://localhost:8787/mcp`.*
